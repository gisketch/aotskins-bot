## ü§ñ Reto
> Reto is a community-oriented Discord bot, featuring a karma system, a way to reward the best comments, leaderboards, and so much more! React to a post with the `plus` or `minus` emojis to give said user some points for their content. `Curators` can even star (react with the exclusive `10` emoji) posts to give them extra points, and add their comment to a special "Best Of" channel for all to admire!
