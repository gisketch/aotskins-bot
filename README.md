# AOTSKINS Discord Bot
This is a fork from Despedite's Reto bot. It has been personalized to be used with the AOTSKINS' discord server. 

With the creation of the AOTSKINS discord server, we implemented a way to add the thank system from the old aotskins forum. It lead to me finding Despedite's Reto bot which has a similar system. It is open-source, so it allowed me to tweak and make it unique and personalized for the server itself.

The bot adds many new features that's unique to the server.
- Autoroles (when you reach a certain number of thanks)
- Auto Update Leaderboard
- Editing thanks for Admins
